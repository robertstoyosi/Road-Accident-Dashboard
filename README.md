# Road-Accident-Dashboard
![](road_acciedent_image.png)
## Introduction
This project is an Excel-based analysis of road accidents using  data for the years 2021 and 2022. Road safety remains a critical global concern, affecting lives and infrastructure. To contribute to awareness and data-driven safety strategies, I developed a Road Accident Analytics Dashboard. This interactive dashboard is designed to provide valuable insights into accident trends, causes, and patterns, helping stakeholders make more informed decisions to improve road safety.

#### Disclaimer: The dataset and reportsdo not represent any company, institution or country, but just a dummy datasets to demonstrate capabilities of Excel.
## Problem Statement
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to uncover key patterns and insights that can support road safety initiatives. Using data from 2021 and 2022, the objective is to identify high-impact areas by tracking casualty trends and breakdowns across several dimensions.
1. Primary KPIs:
   - Total Number of Casualties resulting from road accidents.

   - Casualty Severity Distribution: Breakdown into Fatal, Serious, and Slight casualties, along with their respective percentages of the total.

   - Highest Casualties by Vehicle Type: Identification of the vehicle type involved in the most casualties (e.g., Cars)
2. Secondary KPIs:
   - Total Casualties by Vehicle Type: Analysis across categories such as Cars, Buses, Vans, Bikes, Agricultural vehicles, and Others.
3. Trend Analysis:
   - Monthly Casualty Comparison: A side-by-side analysis of casualties by month for 2021 and 2022, helping identify patterns or anomalies across years.

4. Road Conditions & Environment:
   - Maximum Casualties by Road Type: Includes single/dual carriageways, roundabouts, slip roads, and one-way streets.

   - Casualties by Road Surface: Classification by surface condition (Dry, Wet, Snow/Ice) to understand environmental impacts.

   - Casualties by Area and Light Condition: Compares Urban vs Rural settings and Daylight vs Dark periods to highlight where and when most accidents occur.

## Data Analysis
To enhance usability and provide a centralized overview, I created a dedicated "Data Analysis" sheet that consolidates key pivot tables for quick reference. This sheet serves as a valuable resource for users, developers, or clients to explore trends without needing to navigate the full dataset.This structured analysis enables users to quickly identify key patterns, monitor year-over-year trends, and assess factors contributing to higher accident rates.

 Below is a preview of the Data Analysis sheet as implemented in Excel

 ## Visualization:
Finally, the dashboard was created by inserting and customizing pivot charts based on the corresponding pivot tables. To ensure a user-friendly and interactive experience, slicers and timelines were incorporated. Hyperlinks and connections were also added to relevant icons for seamless navigation.

Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.
